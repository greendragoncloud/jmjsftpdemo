This code provides a set of tools to handle SFTP file transfers between an SFTP server and OCI, and also to convert and manage file contents within Oracle. 

It uses APEX_JSON for JSON manipulation and DBMS_CLOUD for interactions with OCI.

See the JMJ Blog article "An SFTP API for Oracle ATP and APEX #JoelKallmanDay" for more details.
